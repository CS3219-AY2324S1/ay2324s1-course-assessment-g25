This service is for a collaborative code editor with [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io), [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev), [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

As users edit the code, changes will be automatically persisted and syncedâ€”allowing for collaborative code editing experience. Users will also be able to see who else is currently online and each others cursors.
